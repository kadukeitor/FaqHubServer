                            example, "What is *
                            dialog" matches the following variations:</p>
                            <ul class="bullets">
                                <li><p></p>

                                "Dialog" do not matter. Users need to type only the sentence that begins
                                with "what is" and ends with "Dialog."</p>

                            <p class="p">However, if you place an
                                asterisk it does not match to a sentence where there aren't any words in
                                place of the asterisk. For example, "What is dialog" does not match to "What
                                is * dialog". The asterisk is used to indicate that a word, or words, must
                                occupy that space.</p>

                            it is written, but any words can precede it or follow it.</p>

                            <p class="p">For example, "$ is a dialog" matches the following variations:</p>

                        <dd class="dd"><p class="p">You can use both wildcards together too. For example, the variation

                            a greater variety of user text to the input. However, be careful when you
                            use wildcards, especially the asterisk, because users can ask questions that
                            might be different from the meaning of the specific input. For example, "$
                            what is * dialog" can also match to the question "So what is a dialog, can I
                            use it to cheat on an exam".</p>
